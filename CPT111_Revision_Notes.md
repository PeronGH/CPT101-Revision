### Types of Computers

* Mainframe computers: Large computers that were popular in the <u>1960s</u>
* Super computers: Very powerful computers that were developed in the <u>1970s</u>
* Workstations: Smaller computers that were designed for specific tasks (e.g. graphic design, chip design) and could be placed on a desktop. These computers were cheaper than mainframe and super computers.
* Microcomputers: Computers that were used by engineers
* Personal computers: Computers that were marketed for personal use
* Microcontrollers: Small computers that were used in specialized applications such as calculators and automobiles
* Servers: Computers that were used to manage networking, web, and cloud services, allowing users to share resources and storage and access applications over a network
* Trend: There has been a trend towards increasing the performance and decreasing the size of computers over time
* Future: It is possible that in the future, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) will be developed, allowing people to interact with computers using their thoughts.

### Computer Generations

1. The first generation of computers (1940-1956) used vacuum tubes and were the first electronic computers. They were large, expensive, and consumed a lot of electricity. Some examples of first-generation computers include the ENIAC and UNIVAC.
2. The second generation of computers (1956-1963) used transistors, which were smaller and more reliable than vacuum tubes. They were also faster and more energy efficient than first-generation computers. Some examples of second-generation computers include the IBM 1401 and the DEC PDP-1.
3. The third generation of computers (1964-1971) used integrated circuits (ICs) instead of transistors. ICs are small electronic devices that contain transistors and other components on a single chip of silicon. Third-generation computers were much smaller and more powerful than their predecessors. Some examples of third-generation computers include the IBM System/360 and the DEC PDP-8.
4. The fourth generation of computers (1971-present) used microprocessors, which are ICs that contain the processing unit of a computer. Microprocessors made it possible to create compact, powerful computers that could be used for a wide variety of applications. Some examples of fourth-generation computers include the IBM PC and the Apple Macintosh.

### Consequences of Ignoring Hardware Details

* Unsuitable equipment are ordered for programmers
* Unsuitable software fails to exploit the performance advantages offered by revolutionary new circuits.â€¨

### Categories of Computer Hardware

* Input devices: These are devices that allow you to enter data into a computer, such as a keyboard, mouse, touchpad, scanner, and microphone.
* Processing: This refers to the central processing unit (CPU) and arithmetic logic unit (ALU) of a computer, which are responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.
* Output devices: These are devices that allow you to view or print the results of a computer's processing, such as a monitor, printer, and speakers.
* Storage: This refers to devices that allow you to save data for later use, such as hard drives, solid state drives, and optical drives.
* Communication: These are devices that allow a computer to connect to other devices or networks, such as networking chips, modems, and Bluetooth adapters.

### Computer Software

#### System software

* Communication with hardware
* Resource management
* Facilitates communication among application programs

#### Application software

* Benefits/assists the user

### Backward Compatibility

Backward compatibility, also known as downward compatibility, refers to the ability of newer hardware or software to work with older hardware or software. This is important because it allows users to continue using their existing equipment and software when they upgrade to newer technology.

### VHDL

* VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) is a programming language used to describe the behavior of electronic circuits.
* It is commonly used to design and document digital logic circuits, such as those found in computers and other electronic devices.
* VHDL is a hardware description language, meaning that it is used to describe the behavior of a circuit at a high level, rather than specifying the exact steps that the circuit should take to perform a particular task.
* VHDL can be used to simulate the behavior of a circuit before it is actually built, allowing designers to test and debug their designs before committing to expensive fabrication processes.
* VHDL is used in a wide range of applications, including the design of CPUs, memory systems, and other complex digital circuits.

### Computer Systems Hierarchy

1. Hardware: This is the physical equipment that makes up a computer system, including the processor, memory, storage devices, input/output devices, and other components.

2. Operating system: This is a collection of software that manages the hardware resources of a computer and provides a platform for other programs to run on. Examples of operating systems include Windows, macOS, and Linux.

   * The kernel is a central part of the operating system that manages the resources of the computer, including the CPU, memory, and input/output devices.

   * The kernel is responsible for scheduling tasks for the CPU to execute, ensuring that they are run in a fair and efficient manner.

   * The kernel also provides security, protecting the system and its resources from unauthorized access or tampering.

3. Application software: This is software that is designed to perform specific tasks, such as word processing, spreadsheet creation, web browsing, and so on.

   * A program must be supported by the operating system in order to run on a computer.

   * The program can access the resources of the operating system through the application programming interface (API).

#### Benefits

* Modularity: A hierarchical system is divided into smaller, modular components, which makes it easier to understand and modify.
* Reusability: Components at higher levels of the hierarchy can be reused in different contexts, which can save time and effort.
* Extensibility: New components can be added at any level of the hierarchy, which allows the system to evolve and adapt to changing needs.
* Scalability: A hierarchical system can be easily scaled up or down, depending on the needs of the system.
* Flexibility: A hierarchical system is flexible, as it allows different components to be swapped in and out or modified as needed.
* Robustness: A hierarchical system is more resistant to failure, as the failure of one component does not necessarily affect the entire system.

### Advantages of OS

* Easier to use: An operating system provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easier for users to interact with the computer and perform tasks.
* Easier programming: An operating system provides a platform for developers to create programs that can run on the computer. The operating system handles many of the low-level details of programming, allowing developers to focus on creating applications that meet the needs of users.
* Protect system resources: An operating system helps to protect system resources, such as memory and input/output devices, from unauthorized access or tampering. This is important because it helps to ensure that no single process or user can negatively impact the performance of the system.
* Fair and efficient distribution of system resources: An operating system is responsible for scheduling tasks and managing the allocation of resources, such as the CPU and memory, to ensure that all programs and processes are run in a fair and efficient manner.

### Moore's Law

A prediction made by Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, in 1965 that the number of transistors on a computer chip would double approximately every two years.

### Interaction Between Hardware and Software

* WIMP: WIMP stands for "windows, icons, menus, pointer." It refers to the GUI of many modern operating systems, which is based on the use of windows, icons, menus, and a pointer (such as a mouse cursor) to interact with the system.
* Internet: The internet is a global network of computers that allows users to communicate and share information. It is made up of hardware (such as servers and routers) and software (such as web browsers and servers). The interaction between hardware and software is crucial to the operation of the internet, as it enables users to access and share information through their computers and other devices.

### Trends of Computing

* Scientific computing: This refers to the use of computers to model and simulate scientific phenomena, such as weather patterns and the behavior of molecules.
* Business computing: This refers to the use of computers to automate and support business processes, such as accounting, payroll, and customer relationship management.
* Personal computing: This refers to the development of personal computers, which are small, affordable, and easy to use, making them accessible to individuals and households.
* Pervasive computing: This refers to the integration of computing technology into everyday objects and environments, such as smart homes and wearable devices.
* Mobile computing: This refers to the development of portable computing devices, such as laptops and smartphones, that allow users to access information and communicate from anywhere.
